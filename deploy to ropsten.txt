continiue this, the issue is that the geth command doesn't seem to be running well. if I run this
eth.getBlock("latest").number I get 0. Maybe delete the chain data and start again

trying to deploy using truffle running the test net locally
-----------------------------------------------------------
steps: https://medium.com/@guccimanepunk/how-to-deploy-a-truffle-contract-to-ropsten-e2fb817870c1

ran this command to create an account on Ropsten

geth --testnet account new
used passphrase : DX25Test
Got account {98b760f33ef7cd36117982b1aae7658406068ba8}

private key created here: C:\Users\fikre\AppData\Roaming\Ethereum\testnet\keystore

need to top up the account using some faucet or something
	tried: this:http://faucet.ropsten.be:3001/
	this worked: https://faucet.metamask.io/


you can search for the account here: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/

run geth instance
geth --testnet --fast --rpc --rpcapi eth,net,web3,personal


open geth console in another cmd
geth attach http://127.0.0.1:8545

unlock the account

list accounts (including one you just created)
eth.accounts[0]

unlock the account we created (using above password)
personal.unlockAccount(eth.accounts[0])

haven't tried this but I think it unlocks for a longer time web3.personal.unlockAccount(web3.personal.listAccounts[0], "password", 15000)



migrate the contract to the network
Go back into your Truffle folder with your compiled smart contract and run this command: (can do this from VSCode)
truffle migrate --network ropsten


Gave up on running ropsten locally and used Infura and metamask instead (using account1 in metamask, not the account created above)

Steps: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/23279/steps-to-deploy-a-contract-using-metamask-and-truffle

install truffle-hdwallet-provider
	npm install truffle-hdwallet-provider --save    is being a pain to install
	had to install python first and had to isntall c++ stuff on VS2015 when it was asking for windows 8 dev something
	needed to run these 
		npm install --global --production windows-build-tools



added this to truffle

var HDWalletProvider = require("truffle-hdwallet-provider");


    ropsten: {
      
	network_id: 3,
      
	gas:   2900000,
      
	provider: new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://ropsten.infura.io/YB2gyYdgEDYofYvis6m7"),
    
    },

mnemonic is the metamask mnemonic for my local account

deployed calling 
> truffle migrate --network ropsten

deployed contract: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xb18c57e62506a6c43d00b9efe8cdff15a2c1308e
	the ethereum account used for the deployment: 0xf1863099bee6def00a14b9720de5f1400d515d96
